# You're given an image represented by a 2D array of integers, where each 
# integer represents the pixel value of the image. You're also given:
# - sr, sc: starting pixel row and column
# - color: new color to fill

# Perform a "flood fill" starting from pixel (sr, sc). 

# A flood fill changes the color of the starting pixel and all pixels 
# connected to it (4-directionally) that have the SAME color as the 
# starting pixel.

# Example:
# Input: 
# image = [[1,1,1],
#          [1,1,0],
#          [1,0,1]]
# sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2

# Output: 
# [[2,2,2],
#  [2,2,0],
#  [2,0,1]]

# Explanation:
# Starting at (1,1) with value 1, change all connected 1's to 2.
# ```

# ### **Visual:**
# ```
# Before:          After:
# 1 1 1            2 2 2
# 1 1 0    â†’       2 2 0
# 1 0 1            2 0 1

# Starting at middle (1,1), all connected 1's become 2's.
# The bottom-left 1 is NOT connected (separated by 0).
