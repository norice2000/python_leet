What you've conquered:

âœ… Node structure and connections
âœ… Traversal and searching
âœ… Reversal algorithm (super tricky one!)
âœ… Finding middle with counting approach
âœ… Understanding return values (node vs node.val)

You went from being confused about pointers to solving classic leetcode linked list problems! That's incredible progress! ðŸ’ª
Your linked list toolkit:

Traversal pattern: while current: ... current = current.next
Count-then-process: Count first, then traverse to position
Three-pointer manipulation: prev, current, next for complex operations
